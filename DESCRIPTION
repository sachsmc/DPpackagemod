Description: This package contains functions to perform inference via
        simulation from the posterior distributions for Bayesian
        nonparametric and semiparametric models. Although the name of
        the package was motivated by the Dirichlet Process prior, the
        package considers and will consider other priors on functional
        spaces. So far, DPpackage includes models considering Dirichlet
        Processes, Dependent Dirichlet Processes, Dependent Poisson-
        Dirichlet Processes, Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes, Polya
        Trees, Linear Dependent Tailfree Processes, Mixtures of
        Triangular distributions. Currently the package
        includes semiparametric models for marginal and conditional
        density estimation, allowing for measurement error on the x and y variables.
        This is a modification of the original DPpackage to allow for measurement 
        error modeling in the dpcdensity model.
